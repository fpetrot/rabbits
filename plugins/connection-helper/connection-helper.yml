    This plugin simplify the connection process of character based ports like UARTs.
    Without this plugin, the user must specify, for each character port, a backend to connect to (or possibly another character port).
    This can be tedious if the platform has multiple UARTs, that must be connected to different backends, depending on the use case.
    This plugin acts in two ways:
      - It auto-connects non-connected character port to an STDIO chardev backend if this one is not in use, or to a null chardev backend otherwise.
      - It adds several parameters to simplify character port binding on the command line. For example, if the platform has a `uart0` component having a character port, it will add a `-connect-uart0-to` parameter that understand several values like stdio, serial, ...
    See -help for more details.
